description : |
    <p>Given a genome and a query, find characterized proteins whose descriptions match the query, and then search the genome for homologs of those proteins. You can use any Genome object. - This is the KBase wrapper for <a href="http://papers.genomics.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/genomeSearch.cgi/">Curated BLAST</a> -  </p>
