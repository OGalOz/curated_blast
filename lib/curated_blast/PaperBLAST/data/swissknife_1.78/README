OVERVIEW
--------

Swissknife is a Perl module for creating and parsing Swiss-Prot files.


AVAILABILITY
------------

The latest version of Swissknife is available from:

   https://sourceforge.net/projects/swissknife/files/latest/download
   ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/swissprot/Swissknife/


INSTALLATION
------------

Use the following commands:

   gunzip Swissknife.tar.gz
   tar xf Swissknife.tar
   cd SWISS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make install

Alternatively, you may simply copy the lib/SWISS directory (the
directory itself with all the files it contains) to a directory in
your PERLLIB.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

Swissknife has been tested with Perl version 5.00502 and higher.

External modules used: 

   Carp
   Data::Dumper
   Exporter
   
All of these are part of the Perl distribution.


BUGS
----

A segmentation fault occurs in very rare cases under some builds of
perl 5.8. Run the test suite to check if this is the case on your
platform.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

The Swissknife modules are documented using the POD (plain old
documentation format). When installed, the documentation is
accessible by typing "perldoc SWISS::Entry" at the command
prompt, and similarly for other modules.
